# Rudin, Chapter 11 — the space `ℒ²(μ)`

Definitions transcribed from Walter Rudin, *Principles of Mathematical Analysis*, 3rd edition,
Chapter 11 (Definitions 11.34, 11.39, 11.41, 11.44 and equation (86) of Chapter 8).

Rudin builds measure theory from scratch — rings of sets, outer measures, the Carathéodory
extension, measurable functions and the integral — and all of that is available in Mathlib and
is reused: `MeasureTheory.OuterMeasure`, `MeasurableSet`, `Measurable`, `Integrable`, and the
Bochner integral `∫ x, f x ∂μ`.

What is set up here is Rudin's space `ℒ²(μ)` in his own terms — a measurable function whose
square is integrable — together with the norm `‖f‖₂ = (∫ |f|² dμ)^{1/2}`, Cauchy sequences and
convergence *in the mean*, phrased with explicit `ε`'s rather than through Mathlib's `Lp`
quotient space.  Working with functions rather than with equivalence classes is what makes the
statement of the Riesz–Fischer theorem match the book.
